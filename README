A project to develop a bulk download and FTP service to a central repository 
that will maintain original file timestamps, extract file level metadata, 
create file checksums and periodically validate checksums for continued file integrity. 

Users merely need to upload a list of URLs to download or an FTP address and 
when the process completes they can download the requested files and file metadata 
to their local environment.

Funding for the CINCH: Capture, Ingest, & Checksum tool is made possible through 
an IMLS Sparks! Ignition grant.
