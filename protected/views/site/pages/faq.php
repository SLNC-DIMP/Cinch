<h3>How can I use Cinch?</h3>
<p>We're currently in alpha testing with a small group of users.  When Cinch is released live if your institution is a library or other cultural entity in the state of North Carolina you can take advantage of our hosted service.
Please send an email to the Cinch administrative team (<a href="mailto:cinch_admin@cinch.nclive.org">Cinch Admin</a>) and we'll set you up with an account.  If your are not a North Carolina based cultural institution or would prefer to host a Cinch
instance yourself please see our <a href="https://github.com/lfarrell/Cinch">GitHub page</a> for instructions on installing Cinch.</p>

<h3>Why can my upload list only have 4,500 files listed for Cinch to collect?</h3>
<p>This is because our server has problems dealing with a large number files at one pass.  However feel free to upload as many lists as you like.  We'll get to them all.</p>
